We are asking you to participate in a research study titled “Robotability: computing plausibility of robot deployment in the wild”. This study is being led by Maria Teresa Parreira, Information Science Department, and Frank Bu and Matthew Franchi, Computer Science Department at Cornell University. The Faculty Advisor for this study is Prof. Wendy Ju, Information Science Department at Cornell University.

 

What the study is about  

This study aims to create and implement the robotability score, a measure of quality of robot navigation in the wild. This score will be conceptualized based on expert interviews and surveys, and make use of publicly available urban data, as well as in-the-wild robot deployment for verification. This study will contribute with computational methods for producing a new, formalized metric to evaluate feasibility of robot navigation in urban spaces.

 

What we will ask you to do  

The experiment should take no longer than 25 minutes in total. You will be asked to provide your opinion on a set of indicators that may play a role into wheeled robot navigation in urban spaces. You will be asked to provide some information regarding your current professional occupation. All data associated with the survey will be anonymized.

Participation is voluntary and participants may withdraw at any time.

 

Risks and discomforts  

There are no risks associated with your participation.

 

Benefits  

There is no direct benefit to you from participating in this study. The data we collected in this study will be used to advance research in improving interactive experiences, and expanding knowledge of human behavior. This can potentially be beneficial to everyone in society.

 

Compensation for participation  

We will not provide compensation for the participation.

 

Audio/Video Recording  

There will be no audio or video recordings.



Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security


	
	Data may exist on backups and server logs beyond the timeframe of this research project.
	
	
	Confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. We cannot guarantee against interception of data sent via the internet by third parties.  
	
	
	We anticipate that your participation in this Qualtrics survey presents no greater risk than everyday use of the Internet.
	
	
	Please note that email communication is neither private nor secure. Though we are taking precautions to protect your privacy, you should be aware that information sent through e-mail could be read by a third party.




Follow up studies 

We may contact you again to request your participation in a follow up study. As always, your participation will be voluntary, and we will ask for your explicit consent to participate in any of the follow up studies.

 


If you have questions  

If you have questions on the project or participant data use, you may contact Maria Teresa Parreira at mb2554@cornell.edu or Prof. Wendy Ju at wendyju@cornell.edu. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Participants at 607-255-5138 or access their website at http://www.irb.cornell.edu. You may also report your concerns or complaints anonymously through Ethicspoint online at www.hotline.cornell.edu or by calling toll free at 1-866-293-3077. Ethicspoint is an independent organization that serves as a liaison between the University and the person bringing the complaint so that anonymity can be ensured.",Which option more closely describes your current position? - Selected Choice,Which option more closely describes your current position? - Other - Text,How many years of experience do you have in the topic selected above?,"Professional Occupation

IRBs typically require that people cannot be forced to answer questions. You can achieve this in the validations section of qualtrics by requesting response and not forcing response. Also, adding some differentiating definitions would be helpful. For instance, I am not sure what the exact difference between pedestrian density and pedestrian flow were. The sheet of conditions did not provide answers so a lot of guessing on what you mean happened. Also some of the indicators I viewed as nested within other ones. For instance, traffic management systems likely encompass most of the others so I weighted it more heavily than others.    ",
